## Credit Application Classification

### Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying credit applications as "Good" or "Bad" clients using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to determine which model, Logistic Regression or Random Forest, performs better on a given credit dataset.

### Key Components

1. **Introduction and Background**
   - Importance of credit risk management for financial institutions.
   - Overview of credit scoring models, including parametric (Logistic Regression) and non-parametric (Random Forest) approaches.

2. **Algorithms Overview**
   - **Logistic Regression:** Detailed explanation of its use in credit scoring, including model assumptions and limitations.
   - **Random Forest:** Explanation of the ensemble method and its advantages over parametric models.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
   - Data visualization and imputation strategies.
   - Addressing the issue of an imbalanced dataset.

4. **Model Implementation**
   - **Logistic Regression:** Model development, interaction terms, and evaluation using AUC-ROC.
   - **Random Forest:** Implementation, variable importance analysis, and comparison with Logistic Regression.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Comparative analysis of the models with a focus on their predictive performance and resource efficiency.

### Data and Tools
- **Dataset:** Kaggleâ€™s "Give Me Some Credit" dataset.
- **Languages and Libraries:** R programming, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, and other essential data analysis libraries.
